			## Introduction

while (true) {
	
}

			This document outlines the concept and technical script for utilizing plutonium-based nuclear energy to achieve heat levitation in a 100,000 square foot volume data center, repurposed as a space drone with the capability of faster-than-light (FTL) travel. The objective is to leverage the high energy density of plutonium to generate sufficient thermal lift, corrode Earth's gravity for levitation, and enable FTL travel by achieving maximum F-16 speed repeatedly in each operational frame until the total cumulative speed exceeds the speed of light.
